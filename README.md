## Hippocampal perfusion

This repository contains the data analysis code and (visualization) notebooks related to the preprint:

> "Delineating perfusion across hippocampal subfields and assessing the impact of macrovasculature using 7 Tesla MRI"

 that can be found here.

- The analysis pipeline (see `workflow` for more details) is build using the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system.
- Several `notebooks` are uploaded to support the inspection of the intermediate analysis steps (i.e., hippocampal segmentation and vasculature).
- A more interactive visualization tool of the results is possible using our online data explorer that can be accessed [here](https://tinyurl.com/3z8czuy9/).

Raw imaging data as well as the related code for the image preprocessing steps will be uploaded to a separate data repository after the manuscript has been peer reviewed.

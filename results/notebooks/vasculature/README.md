## Hippocampal vasculature reconstructions

This folder contains HTML notebooks to visualize the vascular reconstructions of each subject and hemisphere. 
Each notebook shows the analysis workflow of the MeVisLab vasculature reconstructions to extract the following components:

- Scatterplot-wise plotting of the hippocampal macrovasculature at different densities
- Vessel diameter
- Distance along the vessel tree from a common ancestor
- Distance of hippocampal tissue to the closest vessel and corresponding diameter
- Labeling efficiency (i.e., B1+)
- Correlation among hippocampal vessel geometry properties

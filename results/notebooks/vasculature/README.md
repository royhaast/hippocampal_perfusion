## Hippocampal vasculature reconstructions

This folder contains HTML notebooks to visualize the vascular reconstructions of each subject and hemisphere. 
Each notebook shows the analysis workflow of the MeVisLab vasculature reconstructions and visualizes several properties:

- Scatterplot-wise plotting of the hippocampal macrovasculature at different densities
- Vessel diameter
- Distance along the vessel tree
- Distance from the hippocampus tissue to the closest vessel
- Labeling efficiency (i.e., B1+)
- Correlation among hippocampal vessel geometry properties
